module Dpl
  # Base class for all concrete providers that `dpl` supports.
  #
  # These are subclasses of `Cl::Cmd` which means they are going to be detected
  # by the first argument passed to `dpl [provider]`, instantiated, and run.
  #
  # Implementors are encouraged to use the provider DSL to declare various
  # features, requirements, and attributes that apply to their provider, to
  # implement any of the following stages (methods) according to their needs
  # and semantics:
  #
  #   * init
  #   * install
  #   * login
  #   * setup
  #   * validate
  #   * prepare
  #   * deploy
  #   * finish
  #
  # The main logic should sit in the `deploy` stage.
  #
  # If at any time the method `error` is called, or any exception raised the
  # deploy process will be halted, and subsequent stages skipped. However, the
  # stage `finish` will run even if previous stages have raised an error,
  # giving the provider the opportunity to potentially clean up stage.
  #
  # In addition to this the following methods will be called if implemented
  # by the provider:
  #
  #   * run_cmd
  #   * add_key
  #   * remove_key
  #
  # Like the `finish` stage, the method `remove_key` will be called even if
  # previous stages have raised an error.
  #
  # See the respective method's documentation for details on these.
  #
  # The following stages are not meant to be overwritten, but considered
  # internal:
  #
  #   * before_install
  #   * before_setup
  #   * before_prepare
  #   * before_finish
  #
  # Dependencies declared as required, such as APT, NPM, or Python are going to
  # be installed as part of the `before_install` stage .
  #
  # Cleanup is run as part of the `before_prepare` stage if the option
  # `--cleanup` was given. This will use `git stash --all` in order to reset
  # the working directory to the committed state, and cleanup any left over
  # artifacts from the build process. Providers can use the DSL method `keep`
  # in order to declare known artifacts (such as CLI tooling installed to the
  # working directory) that needs to be moved out of the way and restored after
  # the cleanup process. (It is recommended to place such artifacts outside of
  # the build working directory though, for example in `~/.dpl`).
  #
  # The method `run_cmd` is called for each command specified using the `--run`
  # option. By default, these command are going to be run as local shell
  # commands, but providers can choose to overwrite this method in order to run
  # the command on a remote machine.
  #
  # @see https://github.com/svenfuchs/cl Cl's documentation for details on how
  # providers (commands) are declared and run.
